# Python chatroom
This chatroom was created to be hosted locally with the localhost IP address however with some experimentation it can be configured to work on the Internet using the host's private IP. The users would have to enter the host's public IP in order to join. However, this was just an experiment to become more comfortable with topics like Python GUIs and port management.

# Running and Testing
The code was written using Pycharm but was ran mainly in Command Prompt. Admin permissions may be required. One instance (or user) can be run from the Pycharm application but additional users will have to be added through new Command Prompt windows. The Command Prompt window used to run the server will contain the chatroom and activity logs.

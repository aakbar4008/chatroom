# Python chatroom
This chatroom was created to be hosted locally with the localhost IP address however with some experimentation it can be configured to work on the Internet using the host's private IP. The users would have to enter the host's public IP in order to join. However, this was just an experiment to become more comfortable with topics like Python GUIs and port management.
